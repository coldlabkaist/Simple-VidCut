# Simple-VidCut
Video trimming UI for behavior recording videos


## Installation
### Option A — Run from source (Conda, Fast Execution)
**Requirements**
- Anaconda / Miniconda installed
- **ffmpeg** must be installed and set in the **system environment variables**. (or ffmpeg exe file should be installed in SimpleVidCut directory)

  
1. Download SimpleVidCut.py, vidcut.yaml from GitHub to any folder you like.

2. Open a terminal in that folder. Create the environment:

```
conda env create -f vidcut.yaml
```

3. Activate & run:

```
conda activate vidcut
python SimpleVidCut.py
```

### Option B — Run the prebuilt app (Windows, Easy Installation)

1. Download MBTI.zip from [drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WtHEBoWNKgDINvH8BCLcWItzOH8xQzPP/view?usp=sharing) to any folder you like.

2. Extract the ZIP in that folder.
Do not delete any files inside the extracted folder—the EXE needs the accompanying files to run.

3. Run SimpleVidCut.exe.

Window defender can work because it is a file created by an unknown publisher, but if you press the View Details button to run it once, the window will not appear afterwards and can work conveniently.
